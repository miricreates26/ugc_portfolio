Portfolio Website Description (LLM-ready)
General Overview

Design and build a single-page, full-width portfolio website for a UGC content creator working primarily with brands in the yoga, wellness, and travel niche.

The website should feel:

Warm and friendly, while remaining professional

Editorial and magazine-like

Visually calm, inspiring, and trustworthy

Exciting to work with, while clearly explaining what brands can expect

The site is static only (no backend), but structured in a clean, modular way so content can be updated manually without technical complexity.

Design Principles

Minimal color system

One primary background color

One primary text color

Easy to change via centralized variables

Slightly rounded corners on cards and images (subtle, elegant)

Generous white space (editorial / magazine layout)

Typography:

Mix of elegant serif (headings, emphasis)

Clean, Instagram-native sans-serif (body text, UI)

Fully responsive, mobile-first

All editable content (text, images, videos, links) must be located in clearly defined, centralized sections or configuration files, not scattered across the codebase
(do not oversimplify, but keep it organized and explicit)

Navigation

Sticky navigation bar, always visible

Minimal, text-based links

Clicking a link smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section

One primary CTA (e.g. “Contact”) visible:

In the navigation

Repeated at the bottom of the page

Page Structure & Sections
1. Hero Section

Full-width hero section

Large background image (portrait or lifestyle)

Centered overlay card containing:

Name

Short, warm introduction

Email address

Instagram handle/link

High contrast for readability

Immediately communicates personality and niche (wellness / travel / yoga)

2. Introduction + Video Work

Short editorial-style text introducing her work and approach

Below the text: a horizontal row of 4 video cards

Each video:

Displayed inside a phone-shaped frame or phone icon

Does not autoplay

Starts playing only when clicked

Videos are uploaded manually

Purpose: showcase UGC video work clearly and cleanly

3. UGC Photography Section

Title: UGC Photography

A framed container holding a responsive grid gallery

Multiple rows of square or slightly rounded images

Editorial spacing

Optimized for Instagram-style photography

Manual image uploads

4. Results / Performance Section

Title: Results

Show real social proof only

Layout includes:

Performance photos with a small Instagram-style circular profile overlay

Real screenshots of Instagram metrics (likes, engagement, etc.)

No fake numbers, no generated stats

Clean card-based layout

Purpose: reassure brands and set expectations clearly

5. “More About Me” Section

Personal, warm section

Includes:

A portrait image (rounded or organic shape)

Text describing her background, values, and working style

Softer tone than previous sections

Builds emotional connection

6. Contact Section (Footer)

Clearly separated final section

Title: Contact Me

Contains clickable icons + links for:

Instagram

Email

LinkedIn

Repeats the main CTA

Mobile-friendly tap targets

Content Management Constraints

All content is updated manually

No CMS, no backend

Text, images, videos, and links must be:

Easy to locate

Logically grouped

Centralized (e.g. config files, content objects, or clearly labeled sections)

Designed so two people can comfortably maintain it

Future-Proofing (Not implemented yet, but planned)

The structure should allow easy addition later of:

Brand logos

Testimonials from clients

Target Emotional Outcome

When a brand lands on the site, they should feel:

Well informed

Inspired

Excited to collaborate

Confident they understand the creator’s style, quality, and results
